My kinesis advantage notes
==========================

Things to try:
trigger a tap dance with the `\|` key which is seldom used

[windows hyper key fix](https://www.howtogeek.com/445318/how-to-remap-the-office-key-on-your-keyboard/)
tldr; `REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-officeapp\Shell\Open\Command /t REG_SZ /d rundll32`

backspace where caps lock is normally

I mapped fn-backspace to delete which is quite common. Now I need to decide what to do about the physical delete key

I should also find a better use of the physical ctrl and alt keys now that ctrl and alt are under backspace and enter dual function keys.

can I copy where other keyboards (moonlander) put the kp-layer shift buttons?
 * they put layer 1 shift under the left shift key, there's no key there on kinesis
 * they put layer 2 shift under semicolon key

perhaps I can remap my right control key to meh, and use a press and hold right control key elsewhere (pinkey finger backslash is normal)

I should change nextmatch.py to have a version that only searches the current workspace.
