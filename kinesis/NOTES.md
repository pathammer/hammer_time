My kinesis advantage notes
==========================

Things to try:

add a refresh ctrl-r or f5 to my tab nav layer
map my tab nav shortucts to clion tab manipulation
find a key to assign to button under shift key!
try home row mods with global quick tap, see if it feels acceptable while typing

need a print screen button of some kind
need shift f10, right now it's a stretch 
what does alt f10 do?
shift escape could do something cool

need to assign something to shift right left bracket center keys

I don't use right ctrl key very much. I have it mapped to win key, I should put something more useful there.
Consider using a symbols layer rather than press shift to get common programming symbols. [example here](https://github.com/fatih/Adv360-Pro-ZMK/blob/V2.0/config/adv360.keymap#L79)
âœ…Need to map left meta key to alt as right now I have no way of typing alt-enter
Need to setup more KC_trans keys to allow layers to inherit from layer below
Potentially move layer 1 wasd gaming layer 10 or something so more sensible layers can inherit from layer 0
My Caps lock tap dance only disables caps when I lift, not after double press and hold. Tried also mapping to double press and it didn't work ðŸ˜¥

trigger a tap dance with the `\|` key which is seldom used

tldr; `REG ADD HKCU\Software\Classes\ms-officeapp\Shell\Open\Command /t REG_SZ /d rundll32`

backspace where caps lock is normally

I mapped fn-backspace to delete which is quite common. Now I need to decide what to do about the physical delete key

can I copy where other keyboards (moonlander) put the kp-layer shift buttons?
 * they put layer 1 shift under the left shift key, there's no key there on kinesis
 * they put layer 2 shift under semicolon key (that's forward slach /)

right pinkey key (the / or ; keys) could be used to trigger something on hold.

I should change nextmatch.py to have a version that only searches the current workspace.
